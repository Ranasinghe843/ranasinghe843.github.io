I am a graduate student at Purdue ECE, working with [Prof. Milind Kulkarni]({{"https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/"}}). I am broadly interested in systems, compilers and high performance computing. My current research focuses on optimized code generation for sparse tensor algebraic operations.

I received my Honours Degree of Bachelor of Science Honours in Engineering (B.Sc.(Hons.) in Engineering) from University of Moratuwa,
where I completed my thesis on Deep Learning through Augmented Reality Based User Interaction for Collaborative Automation under the advisement of
Dr. Ranga Rodrigo.

During my undergrad, I did an internship at LiveLabs Urban Lifestyle Innovation Platform, School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University with the
supervision of 
[Prof. Jie Xiong]({{"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GR9VzaMAAAAJ&hl=en"}}) and
[Prof. Youngki Lee]({{"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhKU0oMAAAAJ&hl=en"}}) on Human Computer Interaction and wifi based indoor localization using direction of arrival estimation techniques.

Upon graduation, before starting my graduate studies, I worked as a Software Engineer at Sysco LABS, Sri Lanka where we developed and maintained applications for Sysco Corporation, USA.
