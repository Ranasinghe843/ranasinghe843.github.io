<span style="color:blue">*I am currently looking for internship opportunities, for summer and fall 2023, in software engineering and machine learning. Email: sranasi@purdue.edu*</span>

I am a junior in Computer Engineering with a passion for Machine Learning and Software Development. I have worked hard to create a diverse skillset ranging from ML model implementation, and embedded programming, to software testing automation and robotics algorithms & simulations. These programming skills are further complemented by my hands-on skills in CAD & PCB designing, 3D printing, and from my experiences with restoring a car from the 1970s and being part of a Grand Prix racing team. This combination of computer, electrical, and mechanical skills allows me to understand products/projects from various aspects at the system level and to use that knowledge to improve my work for better integration with all components of a project.

All of my projects as described in my profile have started with me having minimal knowledge of the respective areas, but I have achieved excellence through determination and perseverance. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and help me grow as an engineer. I am a quick learner, and my debugging and analytical skills have helped me resolve problems with innovative solutions to bring my ideas to life.
