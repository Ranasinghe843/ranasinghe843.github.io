### Graduate Research Assistant, Purdue University, US
(Jan 2021 - Present)

- SparseTDA: Accelerating Sparse Tensor Computations Using Compute Dis-Association With Fusion (June 2022 - Present)
    - Compile time optimizations for complex sparse tensor algebra multiplications using tensor kernel dis-association/distribution and fusion (ongoing).

- SparseLNR: Accelerating Sparse Tensor Computations Using Loop Nest Restructuring (May 2021 - May 2022)
    - Implemented a new algorithm to change the loop nesting structure in code generation for sparse tensor computations.
    - The approach reduces the time complexity of the computation while maintaining a low memory footprint to better utilize the cache.
    - The introduced novel algorithm can obtain can achieve better speedups by orders of magnitude.
    - The paper written won the best paper award at the International Conference on Supercomputing 2022.
    - Tech stack: Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO), C++, CMake, PAPI Cache Stats, Latex

- Enterprise Menu (Jan 2020 - Jun 2020)
    - Enterprise Menu is a Graph-based menu management system for multi-location restaurants. This enables different branches of a restaurant chain to maintain a variation of a single master menu with categories, items, modifiers, and taxes.
    - Work on this component included the use of technologies in the front-end, back-end, database, and deployment. Implemented the most complex sections in the enterprise menu component including but not limited to items, modifier groups and modifier options and integrations to POS/OLO applications.
    - Technologies: JanusGraph, Neo4J, Amazon Neptune Graph DB, NodeJS, ExpressJS, ES6, React/Redux, HTML/CSS, Gulp, Webpack, Mocha/Chai, Java Spring MVC, Wiremock, REST, Jira, GIT, Microservices, SonarQube, Jenkins, GrayLog, AWS SNS, AWS S3.

- Communicator API (May 2019 - Nov 2020)
    - Communicator API facilitates email, SMS and voice message sending functionalities and is used by many other components in the organization.
    - The component features advanced queuing and failure notification alert mechanisms, which also consist of a dashboard view for internal use and testing.
    - Introduced a lock mechanism to distribute the workload among a cluster of instances for sending email SMS and voice messages and various other improvements to the application like dockerizing the component and deploying to ECS.
    - Technologies: MySQL, Twilio integration, SendGrid integration, Slack integration, Bash shell scripting, Redis, Graylog, Symfony, PHP

- Sales Demo Data Pumping Tool (Cloud Reports) (Jan 2019 - Jan 2020)
