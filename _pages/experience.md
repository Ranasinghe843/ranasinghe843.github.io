### Graduate Research Assistant, Purdue University, US
(Jan 2021 - Present)

- SparseTDA: Accelerating Sparse Tensor Computations Using Compute Dis-Association With Fusion (June 2022 - Present)
    - Compile time optimizations for complex sparse tensor algebra multiplications using tensor kernel dis-association/distribution and fusion (ongoing).

- SparseLNR: Accelerating Sparse Tensor Computations Using Loop Nest Restructuring (May 2021 - May 2022)
    - Implemented a new algorithm to change the loop nesting structure in code generation for sparse tensor computations.
    - The approach reduces the time complexity of the computation while maintaining a low memory footprint to better utilize the cache.
    - The introduced novel algorithm can obtain can achieve better speedups by orders of magnitude.
    - The paper written won the best paper award at the International Conference on Supercomputing 2022.
    - Tech stack: Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO), C++, CMake, PAPI Cache Stats, Latex

- Communicator API (May 2019 - Nov 2020)
    - Communicator API facilitates email, SMS and voice message sending functionalities and is used by many other components in the organization.
    - The component features advanced queuing and failure notification alert mechanisms, which also consist of a dashboard view for internal use and testing.
    - Introduced a lock mechanism to distribute the workload among a cluster of instances for sending email SMS and voice messages and various other improvements to the application like dockerizing the component and deploying to ECS.
    - Technologies: MySQL, Twilio integration, SendGrid integration, Slack integration, Bash shell scripting, Redis, Graylog, Symfony, PHP

- Sales Demo Data Pumping Tool (Cloud Reports) (Jan 2019 - Jan 2020)
    - Developed the application from scratch by myself.
    - The application consisted of a UI automation and a data pumping tool to mock an existing user and pump data as a different user by changing data that needs changing. This application was helpful for sales representatives for demo purposes of the Cloud Reports components.
    - Technologies: JavaScript, NodeJS, Puppeteer, Java, CouchDB

- UA-REPORTS (Cloud Reports)
    - Engaged in feature developments in the application mainly in transaction reports section.
    - Universal Admin Reports is a modern reporting application used to provide comprehensive reports for restaurants using CAKE POS devices. Users can view data on sales, payments, transactions, payroll, and taxes and use advanced filtering options to analyze data.
    - The specialty of the application originates from its ability to handle enormous amounts of data for user accessibility.
    - Technologies: NodeJS, ExpressJS, ES6, React/Redux, HTML/CSS, Gulp, Webpack, Mocha/Chai, SonarQube, Jenkins, Graylog, Redis, REST, Docker, AWS ECS, AWS S3, Java Spring Web Flux, Wiremock, REST, Jira, GIT, Microservices, SonarQube, Jenkins, Agile.
