  I am a graduate student at Purdue ECE, working with 
  <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/">Prof. Milind Kulkarni</a>. 
  I am broadly interested in systems, compilers and high performance computing. 
  My current research focuses on optimized code generation for sparse tensor algebraic operations.

  I received my honours degree of Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering
  from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka where I completed my thesis on Deep Learning through 
  Augmented Reality Based User Interaction for Collaborative Automation under 
  the advisement of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YaEJbvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ranga Rodrigo</a>.

  During my undergrad, I did an internship at LiveLabs Urban Lifestyle Innovation Platform, 
  School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University under the
  advisement of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GR9VzaMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Jie Xiong</a> and
   <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhKU0oMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Youngki Lee</a> 
    on Human Computer Interaction and wifi based indoor localization using direction of arrival estimation techniques.
